  # desktop/web. We include explicit platform implementations so the app can
  # resolve the plugin on Windows/macOS/Linux/web.
  # Pin file_picker to a 4.x release for broader platform compatibility with
  # this Flutter SDK. Newer 5.x releases are federated and may require
  # explicit platform packages or a newer Flutter toolchain.
